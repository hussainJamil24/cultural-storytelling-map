# Windows: do these steps in order

## 1. Install these three programs once

- [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win): keep the installer defaults.
- [Python 3.13](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/): choose Python 3.13, and keep the Python launcher enabled.
- [Node.js 24 LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download): keep the installer defaults.

Close PowerShell after installing. Open a **new PowerShell window**.

## 2. Download the correct application

Copy and run these lines one at a time. Use a new folder, even if you already have an older copy.

```powershell
cd $env:USERPROFILE
git clone https://github.com/hussainJamil24/cultural-storytelling-map.git narrify-demo
cd narrify-demo
.\SetupDemo.bat
```

If `narrify-demo` already exists, use a different new folder name in both commands; do not delete your old copy.

Setup downloads dependencies and restores the supplied stories. When it asks for a **Gemini API key**, paste the key Charalampos gives you privately and press Enter. Nothing appears while pasting; this is normal. Alternatively, before setup, save the private file from Charalampos as `backend/.env` (exact name, not `.env.txt`). Setup then keeps that key and does not ask again.

Wait for **PASS: Gemini returned a real companion card** and **Setup complete**. If setup stops, read the error and send Charalampos a screenshot with no key or password visible. Do not continue filming until it passes.

## 3. Run the app

In the same PowerShell window:

```powershell
.\RunDemo.bat
```

Keep the **two new black windows open**. Wait for the browser to open. If it does not, open **http://127.0.0.1:3000** yourself. Close the two windows to stop the app.

Next time, open the `narrify-demo` folder and double-click **RunDemo.bat**. No reinstall is needed. Do not open it twice; if port 8000 or 3000 is already in use, close the earlier app windows first.

## 4. Get the admin login before filming

Open `backend/.demo-accounts.json` using Notepad. Find the account with `"role": "admin"`. Use that entry's email and password to sign in. Other entries are ordinary users. These are new local demo passwords, not the old application passwords.

Do not film the account file, terminal setup, or API key. Keep the admin signed in in a **different browser or browser profile** from the contributor; two ordinary tabs share a login.

## 5. Record the demo

Double-click **CheckDemo.bat** once before recording and make sure every check says PASS.

Follow [DEMO_FILMING_CHECKLIST.md](DEMO_FILMING_CHECKLIST.md). Export **MP4, 1920 x 1080, maximum 1 minute 55 seconds**. Cut typing and waiting. Keep the clicks and their actual results visible.

**Critical proof:** submit a story → show it is pending and absent publicly → admin approves → it appears publicly. Autoapproval must remain off.

The whole presentation is four minutes. The video starts at 1:35 and ends at 3:30; closing/sponsor slides finish by 3:45, leaving 15 seconds spare.

All 16 supplied story records are included. Only 13 are public because 3 are rejected. Four old media links were already missing; use the checklist's new photo/audio rehearsal story for those shots. Do not replace or delete existing stories.
